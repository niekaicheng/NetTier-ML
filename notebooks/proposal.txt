Project Description
the project proposes a Hierarchical Network Intrusion Detection Framework. The system integrates statistical machine learning with deep sequence modeling through a two-stage architecture: It is a two level system that combines the use of simple machine learning techniques with deep sequence modeling. The first stage is traffic filtering The first stage Low level Random Forest model filters out normal traffic quickly based on statistical flow characteristics to be highly efficient. The suspicious traffic is analyzed further in the second stage （attack classification）. The TransECA-Net model is a big-deal model that integrates three-machine learning techs （1D-CNN, Efficient Channel Attention, and Transformers） to identify types of attacks. The experimental test of the CIC-DS2017 data shows high-speed of the system in processing most of the traffic and maintaining the best level of detecting complex attacks.
